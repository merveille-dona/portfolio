## 👋 ABOUT ME

Hello! I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Université Paul Sabatier Toulouse III and a Research Intern at IRIT. I hold an engineering diploma in Telecommunications.

My academic background and research experiences have shaped a strong interest in building **intelligent, secure, and trustworthy systems**. I’ve worked on predictive models for telecom applications and am currently gaining hands-on experience with **large language models (LLMs)** — skills I am eager to apply in the cybersecurity domain.

I’m now seeking a PhD opportunity where I can contribute to advancing the state of AI for cybersecurity — particularly in areas like **threat detection, adversarial robustness, and secure language-based interfaces**.
