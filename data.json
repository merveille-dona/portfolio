  "description": "I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Université Paul Sabatier Toulouse III and a Research Intern at IRIT. I hold an engineering diploma in Telecommunications, providing me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of complex systems.\n\nMy academic background and research experience have fueled a deep interest in developing intelligent, reliable, and trustworthy AI systems. I have worked on predictive modeling for telecommunications applications and am currently gaining hands-on experience with large language models (LLMs). These experiences have broadened my skill set and strengthened my motivation to apply advanced AI techniques to real-world challenges, including but not limited to cybersecurity.\n\nI am particularly interested in advancing AI research in areas such as threat detection, adversarial robustness, explainable AI, and secure, language-based interfaces."
